Large Language Models (LLMs) are a class of machine learning models that are trained on massive datasets consisting of natural language text. These models are capable of understanding, generating, and reasoning with human language.

## What Are LLMs?

LLMs are built using a deep neural network architecture called the Transformer, introduced in the paper "Attention is All You Need". They work by learning patterns in language through billions (or trillions) of parameters.

Popular LLMs include:

- GPT-4 by OpenAI
- Claude by Anthropic
- Gemini by Google DeepMind
- LLaMA by Meta

## Applications

Text summarization

Chatbots and conversational AI

Code generation

Document understanding

Semantic search

## How They Work

LLMs are trained using unsupervised learning â€” typically predicting the next token in a sentence. For example:

Input: "The capital of France is"
Output: "Paris"

They rely on self-attention mechanisms to capture context from large amounts of text.

## Challenges

High computation and memory costs

Biases in training data

Explainability issues

Hallucinations (fabricated responses)

LLMs are still evolving rapidly and form the backbone of modern AI applications like ChatGPT.
